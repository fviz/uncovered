            Welcome to the UN·COV·ERED online exhibition. Art is a powerful way of uncovering layers of meaning,
            exposing hidden facets and perspectives.
            UN·COV·ERED is an online exhibition featuring works that approach this idea in different forms.
            The selected artists bring to light new sides of materials, businesses and computers, exploring ways of
            putting their creations in context with that surrounds them. Inspired by the chosen artwork, we made this
            interactive exhibition where you have to uncover the artworks yourself.

                <span>
                    For the theme resistance van der Kooij has been digging into corruption of files and glitch art. Inspired by the work of Rosa Menkman, Kooij started to do visual research in corruption glitches. The final work is from a computer generating new glitches based upon the source images of previous output.

                <span>
“I want to put myself in a role of the unknowing westerner. Where I am so happy with my clothing and want to thank them for their hard labor”
Leene does this by making fabrics for the workers and with those she communicates back. Just like the workers communicate to us through clothing labels, trying to show the wry reality we live in.

Solitude — Technology has now connected us simultaneously on various online channels, most of us never truly experience solitude. Yet, we struggle with loneliness and a sense of not belonging. For the past decades, we live in a mentality that resources are endless and with no mistake - being alive is a given.
